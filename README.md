### I am Zackary and welcome to my GitHub page where I plan to detail my progress in Cybersecurity.
As I grow and develop my skills, I plan to update this repository to reflect where I am in my goals.

Current Goals:

- [ ]   Complete Google Cybersecurity Professional Certification <br>
- [ ]  Complete Security+ Certification <br>
- [ ]  Have at least three projects documented here. <br>
 ```
  [ ]  1 Project 
  [ ]  2 Projects 
  [ ]  3 Projects 
```
- [ ] Bench 200lbs (Not Counting Bar) <br>
```  
[x]  100lbs 
[ ]  125lbs 
[ ]  150lbs 
[ ]  175lbs 
```
## My Current Cybersecurity Experience <br>
I have been going through Google's Cybersecurity Professional Course and gradually learning the ins and outs of what it means to "Do Cybersecurity." 
So far I have completed a lot of the modules and courses. Some of the more interesting things I have covered have been...
> Basic SQL <br>
> Packet Disection <br>
> Basic Use of Wireshark <br>
> Basic CLI on Linux <br>
